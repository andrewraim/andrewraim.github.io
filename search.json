    "title": "COMPoissonReg: Usage, the Normalizing Constant, and Other Computational Details",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been maintaining the COMPoissonReg package, which facilitates use of the Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) distribution. The normalizing constant of the CMP distribution is central to many computations in the package. Users have occasionally reported strange results that can be traced back to problems computing the normalizing constant. Early versions computed the constant by truncating the series to an finite sum with a fixed number of terms; however, this may yield inaccurate results. We addressed this to some degree in more recent versions in an ad hoc way. In the latest version (0.8.0) of the package, these computations have been revisited in a more principled way. Kimberly Sellers and I recently completed a report describing the updated method, which also demonstrates general use of the package. A vignette version of this report will be included in the package and updated along with any changes in the software."

    "text": "Suppose \\(n\\) respondents are asked to rate several alternatives on a scale from, say, 1 to 5, with 1 being least preferred and 5 being most preferred. How can we determine whether one alternative is significantly more preferred to the others? The data may include covariates which are associated with the preference of interest.\nElizabeth Nichols and I carry out this kind of analysis on map usability in a recent report (Raim and Nichols 2023). With ordinal data recorded in a survey setting, we compare preferences for satellite maps - which display details such as landmarks and terrain - to those of simplified road maps. We make use of a bivariate ordinal regression model to carry out the analysis. Computations are carried out using the mvord R package by Hirk, Hornik, and Vana (2020), which can also support multivariate models with more than two alternatives.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHirk, Rainer, Kurt Hornik, and Laura Vana. 2020. “mvord: An R Package for Fitting Multivariate Ordinal Regression Models.” Journal of Statistical Software 93 (4): 1–41. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v093.i04.\n\n\nRaim, Andrew M., and Elizabeth Nichols. 2023. “A Comparison of Map Usability via Bivariate Ordinal Analysis.” Study Series: Statistics #2023-01.

    "text": "There are powerful tools for working with geographical data in R. For example, the ggplot and sf packages can be used together to display such data. But what about interactive maps which support panning, zooming, and clicks to trigger actions (e.g., highlighting an area)?\nOne way to accomplish this is through Shiny and Leaflet. With this combination of tools, it is relatively easy to stand up an graphical interface. Shiny supports constructs beyond routine R programming which allow variables, displays, and computations to react to user inputs. Leaflet provides widgets for interactive maps.\nThere are already a number of interesting examples on the web, but here is something I put together.\n\nIt displays counties in Maryland along with some randomly placed markers, and displays the count of markers within each county as a choropleth. Users can remove existing markers or add new ones, which in turn triggers the counts to be recomputed and the choropleth to be updated."

    "title": "Generating Latex Tables in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nPreparing Latex tables from results of a simulation study or other program can be tedious and time-consuming when done by hand. Especially when the process must be repeated many tables as results are updated to correct mistakes or to investigate unexpected findings. Hours spent manually adjusting formatting of table entries and typing ampersands between them could be spent in better ways. Fortunately, there are some excellent tools in R to help. Taking time to learn the tools and automate your table generation may be worth the investment. We will give a brief example in this post. This is only based on my experience; there are likely even better tools and methods that I have yet to learn.\n\n\nObjective\nOur objective will be to generate a Latex table for the first six rows of the airquality dataset.\n\nR&gt; head(airquality, n = 6)\n  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day\n1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1\n2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2\n3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3\n4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4\n5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5\n6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6\n\nWe would also like to meet the following criteria.\n\nCriteria for formatting of the rendered Latex table.\n\nUse booktabs and make all separators horizontal lines.\nUse multiline columns to render column names.\nAdd several headers which group together columns in the display.\nSpecify a caption and a label which can be used in Latex references.\nRequest the table to be placed “here”.\n\nCriteria for table content.\n\nInclude row labels (observation number) in the table as a column.\nFormat numbers in a purposeful way.\nDisplay the Month and Day columns together as a date.\nCustomize column names to be more descriptive.\n\nEnsure that the generated Latex code is legible.\n\nPad strings in a given column so that they are nicely aligned in the code.\n\n\nTo do this, we will make use of the following tools.\n\nThe Tidyverse framework to manipulate tables.\nThe knitr package for reproducible research in R. In particular, we will use the kable function. to generate Latex from data frames.\nThe kableExtra package to handle some additional Latex work.\nThe built-in sprintf function to format table entries.\n\n\n\nPreparing the Data Frame\nFirst let us load the packages we will use.\n\nR&gt; library(knitr)\nR&gt; library(dplyr)\nR&gt; library(tibble)\nR&gt; library(stringr)\nR&gt; library(kableExtra)\n\nBefore converting to Latex, let us format the entries and column names as we would like them to appear.\n\ntbl = head(airquality, n = 6) %&gt;%\n    rownames_to_column(var = \"Num\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(Date = sprintf(\"%04d-%02d-%02d\", 1973, Month, Day)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Solar.R = sprintf(\"%0.2e\", Solar.R)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(TempC = sprintf(\"%0.2f\", 5/9 * (Temp - 32))) %&gt;%\n    select(Num, Date, Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, TempC)\n\nWe have done the following.\n\nAssemble Month and Day into Date, where 1973 is the year which all observations were taken (according to the manual page for the dataset).\nConvert Solar.R to a string with the original value in scientific notation.\nConvert temperature Temp from Farenheit to Celcius and call the result TempC.\nUse tibble::rownames_to_column to include row labels in the table as the Obs column.\n\nThis produces the following table.\n\nR&gt; print(tbl)\n  Num       Date Ozone  Solar.R Wind TempC\n1   1 1973-05-01    41 1.90e+02  7.4 19.44\n2   2 1973-05-02    36 1.18e+02  8.0 22.22\n3   3 1973-05-03    12 1.49e+02 12.6 23.33\n4   4 1973-05-04    18 3.13e+02 11.5 16.67\n5   5 1973-05-05    NA       NA 14.3 13.33\n6   6 1973-05-06    28       NA 14.9 18.89\n\n\n\nGenerating Latex\nWe can now generate code to display out formatted table as Latex code.\n\nout = tbl %&gt;%\n    mutate(Solar.R = str_pad(Solar.R, width = 10, side = \"left\", pad = \"\\u00A0\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Wind = str_pad(Wind, width = 6, side = \"left\", pad = \"\\u00A0\")) %&gt;%\n    kable(format = \"latex\", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = \"\", align = c(\"rlrrrr\"),\n        caption = \"My formatted airquality table.\", label = \"airquality\",\n        col.names = c(\"Number\", \"Date\", \"Ozone (PPB)\", \"Radiation (Ly)\",\n            \"Wind (MPH)\", \"Temp (C)\")) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")) %&gt;%\n    add_header_above(c(\"Observation\" = 2, \"Solar\" = 2, \"Weather\" = 2))\n\nWe have done the following.\n\nLeft-pad the Solar.R and Wind fields with the unicode “nbsp” character, which will render as a space in our resulting code rather than be ignored, as a regular space would.\nUse kable to generate a Latex table from our data frame. We have specified options such as cell alignments, the caption, and the label, which should be familiar to Latex users. We have also specified descriptive column names here.\nThe option hold_position specifies the option !h for how Latex should place the table.\nThe function add_header_above specifies a layer of headers above the column names. These respectively have text “Observation”, “Solar” and “Weather”, and are each two columns wide.\n\nPrinting the result yields the following Latex code.\n\nR&gt; print(out)\n\\begin{table}[!h]\n\n\\caption{\\label{tab:airquality}My formatted airquality table.}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{rlrrrr}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{Observation} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Solar} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Weather} \\\\\n\\cmidrule(l{3pt}r{3pt}){1-2} \\cmidrule(l{3pt}r{3pt}){3-4} \\cmidrule(l{3pt}r{3pt}){5-6}\nNumber & Date & Ozone (PPB) & Radiation (Ly) & Wind (MPH) & Temp (C)\\\\\n\\midrule\n1 & 1973-05-01 & 41 &   1.90e+02 &    7.4 & 19.44\\\\\n2 & 1973-05-02 & 36 &   1.18e+02 &      8 & 22.22\\\\\n3 & 1973-05-03 & 12 &   1.49e+02 &   12.6 & 23.33\\\\\n4 & 1973-05-04 & 18 &   3.13e+02 &   11.5 & 16.67\\\\\n5 & 1973-05-05 & NA &         NA &   14.3 & 13.33\\\\\n6 & 1973-05-06 & 28 &         NA &   14.9 & 18.89\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe now have a Latex table environment - which is fairly human-readable - that can be copy/pasted into a Latex document, or even included programmatically using Sweave."

    "title": "Worker Tool for Computational Studies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a large statistical simulation or other computational study, it can be labor intensive to kick off all of the runs whose results will be harvested and summarized. Worker is a lightweight tool that seeks to help automate this process. This post gives a brief description; see the webpage for details.\nSuppose our study consists of a parameter that is varied in some way, and we have determined that there are 999 levels of interest. Suppose that we have set up 999 corresponding directories, named as follows.\n\n$ ls -1\nrun001\nrun002\n...\nrun999\n\nIn each folder, suppose there is a script launch.R that runs the corresponding level of the simulation. An output file output.csv is placed in the directory upon successful completion of launch.R. Running the launch.R scripts manually would be extremely tedious, but we could write a loop in our preferred shell scripting language to automate this.\nThe worker takes this concept slightly further; it loops through jobs and runs them sequentially, but multiple workers can be run simultaneously on the same study to achieve “embarrassingly parallel” parallel computing. Workers make use of use lock files to avoid stepping on each other’s toes. This paradigm can be useful in shared computing environments, where users may be asked to limit the number of CPUs requested at any given time. We can start, say, ten workers rather than having to continually monitor a scheduler’s queue and submit more jobs.\nHere is an example of the syntax currently used to invoke each worker in this example.\n\n$ worker.sh -p 'run???' -c 'Rscript launch.R'\n\nAfter all of the runs are completed, we will likely want to load each of the output.csv files and construct tables and plots to summarize the results. This post may be helpful if you are looking to construct Latex tables from a computational study."

See below for details.\n\n\nIris Gauran and I are planning to give a half-day workshop on Rcpp at UMBC. Tentative details are given below. Part of the workshop will be a “quick start”, where we will demonstrate accessing C++ code from R via toy examples. Attendees are encouraged to prepare their laptops for Rcpp programming, and bring them to the workshop to follow along with this portion.\nWe will focus on Rcpp programming in RStudio, which provides a common interface across all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux), and helps to automate some procedural tasks.\n\nInstall R (http://www.r-project.org). The current version as of this writing is 3.4.1 “Single Candle”.\nInstall RStudio Desktop (http://www.rstudio.com). The current version is 1.0.153.\nInstall the Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, and RcppGSL packages.\nSome additional libraries may be needed to compile C++ programs on your computer. These differ depending on your operating system. See http://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites.\n\nThis may be a good time to upgrade if you have older versions of R, RStudio, or any of the listed packages.\nTo test your Rcpp environment, try the following in RStudio.\n\nSelect File =&gt; New File =&gt; C++ File from the main menu. This will create a simple Rcpp program.\nSave the program, say, as example.cpp.\nClick the Source button, which is located in the upper-right corner of the panel with the example.cpp source code. This should produce the output\n\nR&gt; timesTwo(42)\n[1] 84\n\nLocation: University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\nRoom: MP 401 (Math/Stat Seminar Room).\nTime: Friday Sept 22, 1 - 4:30pm.\nCost: This workshop is free for the UMBC community.\nPrerequisites: intermediate knowledge in a high level language like R, Python, or Matlab. Familiarity with R and RStudio is highly recommended.\nSnacks: Light refreshments (coffee and bagels) will be provided.\nAbstract\nR is the preferred computing environment for many statisticians, and is used both in research and applied problems. R has achieved tremendous popularity because it is free, open source, and available on all modern platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). The R programming language is simple and intuitive, and well-suited for fast prototyping of complicated algorithms. However, R users can often find the performance of their programs to be lacking.\nThis workshop will demonstrate Rcpp, an extension of R that facilitates interoperability between R and C++ (Eddelbuettel, 2013). With Rcpp, computationally intensive parts of your program can be written in C++ and seamlessly called from R, potentially giving dramatic performance improvements within the familiar R user environment. We will provide a quick start for new Rcpp users through simple examples, and also examine several larger-scale statistical applications. C++ programming is usually more burdensome than R programming, so we will discuss tradeoffs between optimizing R code and migrating to C++, and ways to minimize suffering while making the transition.\nReferences\n\nDirk Eddelbuettel.

    "text": "Rmarkdown seems to be the most standard way to embed R code and results into a document. Markdown has many benefits compared to Latex: it is much easier to get started with and the source code is closer to a plain readable text document. It is also possible to use Latex within Markdown when an occasional equation is needed. But sometimes you really want to work in Latex without going through Markdown.\nI have been aware that Sweave allows embedded R for Latex documents, but it seemed archaic compared to more modern R tools for reproducible research, and I avoided using it. Recently, I was made aware that Overleaf supports authoring Sweave documents which require very little special markup and are almost like working in regular Latex. After some additional searching, I found that this is also possible without Overleaf. knitr has long been able to do this.\nExamples of Sweave with knitr can be found online, but I thought it would be worthwhile to post several more. See the repo https://github.com/andrewraim/sweave-examples for an example in article format (pdf) and one in Beamer slide format (pdf)."

An abstract and brief outline for the workshop are given here.\nThe workshop builds up to parallel and distributed computing in R, but begins by introducing basics of working in R. Previous experience with R and Rstudio will be helpful, but much of the material should be accessible to new R users with experience in another technical computing language such as Matlab, Python, or Julia. Applications involving statistical and machine learning methods will be presented throughout the workshop. A bachelors degree in a discipline such as statistics, computer science, or mathematics - OR equivalent work experience - should be sufficient to understand the methodology.\nAttendees are encouraged to bring their laptops. Many example codes will be provided, and there will be opportunities at some points during the workshop for users to follow along. If you will be bringing your laptop, the remainder of this page discusses how to prepare it for the workshop.\n\nIt is possible to manually install R, Rstudio, and all packages that will be used in the workshop. But this is quite impractical, especially for the material on parallel and distributed programming which varies somewhat based on the computing platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). Therefore, we highly suggest a second option…\nInstead, we have prepared a Docker container, which is like a virtual machine. This will provide all attendees with the same programming environment which contains all the software needed for the workshop.\n\nInstructions to obtain and run the Docker container are given below. For attendees who cannot install Docker, alternative instructions are provided further below.\nWorkshop contents such as slides, programs, and dataset will be provided at the start of the workshop."

I believe it was due to low disk space - I suggest having at least a 5-10 GB available before installing. For me, a solution was to remove Docker Toolbox, and the Oracle VirtualBox program installed with it, remove the .docker and .virtualbox subdirectories in C:\\Users\\Andrew, and rerun the Docker Toolbox installer. It may also be helpful to temporarily turn off Windows Firewall, or your antivirus program’s firewall if you have one, during the installation."
