# Introduction {-}

This page catalogues software projects and other useful resources on the web,
especially those that I have personally found to be useful or interesting.

Much of the software listed here is free and open source with major
contributions from - or developed entirely by - dedicated community members.
These efforts have resulted in a vast selection of reliable, high quality, and
readily-available software.

# Platforms for Statistical and Scientific Computing

- [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) Declare Bayesian models using a high-level
  modeling language. Models compile into fast executable programs which
  generate samples from posterior distribution using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
  Integrates with several other programming languages including R via the
  [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan) package.

- [MultiBUGS](https://www.multibugs.org) An actively maintained BUGS platform
  for Bayesian modeling, which automates MCMC sampling given a user's model
  specification. Other BUGS variants are
  [OpenBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/openbugs)
  and WinBUGS. [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) also follows a similar
  paradigm.

  Implements a number of numerical methods including integration,
  optimization, and root-finding.

- [Netlib](https://www.netlib.org) A repository of code and documentation for
  numerical methods. A good place to find definitions of standard FORTRAN codes
  for standards such as BLAS and LAPACK.

- [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net) A matrix algebra library for C++.
  Its interface is intuitive and well-documented. The library is accessible to
  Rcpp users through the package
  [RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo).

- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) Another matrix algebra library for C++.
  It is also available to Rcpp users through the package
  [RcppEigen](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppEigen).
  I find this one more difficult to use than Armadillo.

  Using special variables and operations to code functions, analytical
  derivatives may be calculated automatically. Helps to avoid tedious
  hand calculations and numerical accuracy issues in numerical derivatives, 
  Implements a reverse mode and forward mode algorithm.
  [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) also has a library for AD
  which can be accessed in C++ with [some work][stan-ad]. A list of many other
  AD tools for various programming languages are listed
  [here](https://www.autodiff.org).

# Document Authoring Tools

- [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org) System for preparing high quality
  documents. Especially useful for typsetting mathematics. A large selection
  of contributed packages is available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org).

- [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org) System for managing references with Latex.
  Store references in a format-agnostic database file and render them to
  whichever format is needed when making citations.

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org) System for preparing articles, websites,
  books, and other documents with markdown and embedded R, Python, or Julia
  code. Code can be displayed with syntax highlighting and run dynamically as
  documents are compiled to facilitate reproducibility. Supports embedded Latex
  for typesetting math, BibTeX for references, and many other conveniences.

  suitable for text-oriented material such as source code.

- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) a free hosting service for Git projects
  which is maintained by a non-profit organization in Berlin.

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org),
  [Github](https://github.com),
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
  Paid services that host Git projects.
  They each have a free tier with limited hosting of private projects and use
  of [large file storage](https://git-lfs.com), but are a good option for
  enlisting collaborators who do not otherwise have an account.

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) Collaboration environment for writing
  Latex documents. Provides a browser-based editor, and also supports Git to
  work outside of the editor.

- [Box](https://www.box.com),
  [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com),
  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
  Shared storage, for files other than source code

# General Computing

- [The GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org) hosts a number of open source software
  projects, including the [gcc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc) compiler,
  [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) and
  [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) build tools, as well as
  some of the other tools listed on the present page.

- [suckless](https://suckless.org) projects are open source and follow the
  suckless design [philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/). These are
  usually written in C and consist of a core codebase with a minimal set of
  features. Additional features may be added by applying patches (supplied by
  the community) and/or directly modifying the code. Configuration is done by
  editing a header file and recompiling. Use of such software usually requires
  maintaining one's own version of the code base with any customizations and
  managing conflicts when incorporating new code. Some folks enjoy curating
  their own repo of an application with minimal bloat. However, most will
  prefer using more immutable programs which are configured through external
  configuration files or scripts.

- [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) A scheduler to queue up computing jobs
  and run them as processors become available. Useful for running large
  simulations which can require hours or days. Most commonly used on multi-user
  systems and distributed computing clusters, but also useful on a PC.

## Linux

Linux is an operating system (OS) started as a personal project by Linus
Torvalds, who also created Git. An open source approach was taken in its
development, allowing contributions from collaborators around the world, to
become a viable alternative to corporate OS such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS
X, and Unix which was developed at Bell Labs. Linux is bundled in various
distributions (distros), which typically include a desktop environment, service
manager, package manager, and prepackaged software. Users can select a distro
which best meets their needs. The Linux [kernel](https://www.linux.org) is the
basis of all Linux distros.

For Windows and Mac users looking to try Linux, I recommend starting with a
mainstream Linux distro such as Debian or Ubuntu that includes a desktop
environment (e.g., Xfce, KDE, or Gnome). This should provide a usable OS upon
successful installation. There are several possible installation procedures to
consider. To try Linux without making permanent changes to your computer, you
can create a live USB and boot into it; this environment resets each time it is
booted. A more persistent option is to install Linux to a virtual machine. When
ready to set up Linux to boot as the computer's actual OS, most installers
include tools to set up dual boot so you can select between Linux and your
original OS at boot time. If you happen to have an older PC or laptop lying
around, it can serve as an excellent platform for trying Linux.

An alternative open source Unix-based OS, which is not based on the Linux
kernel, is [The FreeBSD Project](https://www.freebsd.org).

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org) A community-maintained Linux distro.
  Distros such as [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com),
  [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) are based on Debian. Debian may be
  prefered over Ubuntu, for example, if you prefer not to use
  [Snap](https://snapcraft.io), to start with a more minimal initial
  installation, or to use something maintained by a community rather than a
  company.

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) A community-maintained Linux distro
  that follows a rolling release model. Good for keeping up with the most
  recent versions of packages. Also good for customization because the initial
  installation is minimal. Not ideal for new Linux users because the
  installation process involves some command line work.

## Window Managers and Tools

Window managers (WMs) are components of desktop environments (DEs) that control
how windows are displayed and how users navigate them. DEs such as Gnome, KDE,
and XFCE in Linux include window managers and suites of graphical applications.
Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X include proprietary
DEs. Some operating systems (especially Linux) facilitate selecting your own WM
and set of graphical applications for a completely customized experience.

There are two major windowing systems for Linux: X11 and Wayland. X11 has been
the standard for many years, while Wayland is maturing in recent years and
becoming more widely adopted. There is an X11 compatibility layer in Wayland,
but window managers generally seem to be intended for one or the other.

- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) A suckless tiling window manager for X11. Has
  inspired - or been used as a basis for - a number of other tiling window
  managers.

- [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus) A suckless status bar for X11.
  Pairs well with dwm for a suckless DIY setup.

- [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/) An extremely minimal suckless
  screen locking tool for X11.

- [st](https://st.suckless.org) The suckless terminal emulator for X11.
  Minimal and light on memory use but can be patched into a full-featured
  terminal.

- [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) A suckless X11 menu tool.
  Can readily be leveraged in scripts to create user defined menus. Menus can
  be quickly traversed using a fuzzy search. Something similar can be
  accomplished on the command line with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

- [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org) A window manager for X11 started as a
  fork of dwm that is non-suckless. Includes many features in the main code
  base and is highly configurable and extensible via Lua scripting.

- [OXWM](https://ox-docs.vercel.app) A window manager for X11 inspired by dwm
  which is written in Rust. Like Awesome WM, it is non-suckless and configured
  via Lua. OXWM seems geared toward preserving the minimalist tiling experience
  of dwm, in contrast to Awesome, but also toward a sensible dwm-like
  experience that would require patches in dwm.

- [Xmonad](https://xmonad.org) Another non-suckless window manager for X11 
  which was inspired by dwm. Highly regarded in the online Linux community. Is
  written in the functional language Haskell; configuration is also done via
  Haskell.

- [dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl) A port of dwm for Wayland.

- [Niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri) A scrolling window manager for Wayland
  that supports some aspects of tiling. I find this one to be very natural and
  intuitive. Here, each workspace is a row of windows where the windows may be
  spawned and removed as needed. One or more columns of the workspace can be on
  screen at a time. Users can navigate within and between workspaces, and
  dynamically rearrange the layout as desired.

- [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) A lightweight but full-featured
  terminal emulator for Wayland. Can be run as a daemon with clients to
  save resources when using multiple instances.

- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) A more sophisticated menu tool
  with support for both X11 and Wayland. Features a "dmenu emulation" mode
  allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement for dmenu.

- [waybar](https://waybar.org) A highly customizable status bar for use with
  Wayland window managers.

- [Awesome Wayland](https://github.com/rcalixte/awesome-wayland) A curated list
  of tools for Wayland.

- [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) A desktop enviroment that is fully featured and
  intuitive while remaining relatively light on system resources. Is visually
  pleasing (subjectively) while avoiding unnecessary graphical effects.

## Graphical Programs

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox) A popular open source web
  browser.

- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) The open source web browser on which
  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) is based.

- [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org) A minimalist open source web browser

  computer which can be edited and maintained as files. Especially useful with
  a writing tablet such as the
  [Wacom Intuous](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos).

- [Write](https://www.styluslabs.com) Another excellent program for handwritten
  notes by Stylus Labs. Appears to be free but not completely open source like
  Xournal.

- [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia) Open source tool for drawing diagrams.

- [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) Control multiple computers using a
  single mouse and keyboard. Computers may be different architectures running
  different OSes. Commercial software by Symless based on their open source
  project [Deskflow](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow).

- [Screenkey](https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/software/screenkey/) Display your
  keystokes in real time as an animated banner; useful for demonstrations.

- [Featherpad](Featherpad) A lightweight graphical text editor with minimal
  prerequisites; in particular, does not require a specific desktop
  environment to be installed. Has some useful features like syntax
  highlighting and tabs and uses familiar keybindings like `Ctrl-C` to copy.

- [qpdfview](https://github.com/bendikro/qpdfview) A PDF viewer that supports
  tabs for opening multiple documents. Does not require any particular desktop
  environment to be installed. Can also view DjVu and Postscript files.

- [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) A lightweight graphical PDF
  viewer that uses Vim-like keybindings for navigation.

## Terminal Programs

  Linux-based systems. Supports scripting which can be used to automate tedious
  tasks.

- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) A collection of open source tools that
  provide a Linux-like experience in Windows, especially through the command
  line.

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) Set up persistent terminal sessions
  that you can detach from and reattach to. Sessions can be arranged into
  tabs with multiple windows on each tab. Useful for running long interactive
  jobs on a server where you ocassionally want to interact by issuing commands.
  Here is a [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) with
  some useful commands and keybindings.

- [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen) An alternative to tmux which
  also provides persistent terminal sessions.

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org) Visual text editor for the terminal. Does
  not require a graphical environment. It is a "modal" editor because usage
  involves switching between several modes. There is a learning curve to become
  comfortable with basic use and then incorporate more advanced capabilities.
  Here is a browsable version of the internal [quick reference][vim-quickref].
  Here is a more condensed [cheat sheet][vim-cheat] that is suitable for
  printing and hanging on a wall. There is also a universe of
  [plugins][vim-plugins] to add functionality and customize the look and feel.
  Some favorite plugins are [vimwiki][vim-wiki] to use Vim as a personal Wiki
  using Markdown (or several other syntax options) and
  [lightline][vim-lightline] to give the status bar a sleek appearance. There
  are also language-specific plugins such as [julia-vim][vim-julia] for Julia.

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) A more recent Vim project with some enhancements.
  The plugin [R.nvim][vim-rnvim] for R appears to turn Neovim into an IDE-like
  environment for R programming. 

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) The traditional alternative to
  Vim which is just as extensive has has an equally dedicated user base. Emacs 
  has a different feel which makes use of chord-style commands.

- [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) A simple user-friendly text editor for
  the terminal. Recommended for new terminal users who are not yet acquainted
  with Vim or Emacs.

- [Fresh](https://sinelaw.github.io/fresh) A terminal-based editor that appears
  to be quite sophisticated but more familiar to non-Vim and non-Emacs users.
  Uses familiar keybindings like `Crtl-C` to copy as defaults, and use of the
  mouse is not discouraged.

- [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org) A well-established email client for the terminal.
  Also see [NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org) which is a fork of Mutt that supports
  some additional features.
