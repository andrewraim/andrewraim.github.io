Much of the software listed here is free and open source with major
contributions from - or developed entirely by - dedicated community members.
These efforts have resulted in a vast selection of reliable, high quality, and
readily-available software. I especially attempt to highlight projects
developed under this philopsophy that I have personally found to be useful or
interesting.

  for Bayesian modeling, which automates MCMC sampling given a user's model
  specification. Other BUGS variants are
  [OpenBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/openbugs)
  and WinBUGS. [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) also follows a similar
  paradigm.

## Linux

Linux is an operating system started as a personal project by Linus Torvalds,
who also created Git. An open source approach was taken in its development,
allowing contributions from collaborators around the world, to become a viable
alternative to corporate operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X,
and Unix which was developed at Bell Labs. Linux is bundled in various forms
called "distributions", which include certain variations of desktop
environments, service managers, package managers, and prepackaged software.
Users can select a distribution(s) which best meets their needs. The Linux
kernel is the basis of all Linux distributions.

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org) A community-maintained distribution of Linux.
  Distributions such as [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com),
  [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) are based on Debian. Debian may be
  prefered over Ubuntu, for example, if you prefer not to use
  [Snap](https://snapcraft.io), to start with a more minimal initial
  installation, or to use something maintained by a community rather than a
  company.

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) A community-maintained distribution of
  Linux that follows a rolling release model. Good for keeping up with the most
  recent versions of packages. Also good for customization because the initial
  installation is minimal.

- [Linux](https://www.linux.org) The Linux kernel.

## Window Managers and Tools

Window managers (WMs) are components of desktop environments (DEs) that control
how windows are displayed and how users navigate them. DEs such as Gnome, KDE,
and XFCE in Linux include window managers and suites of graphical applications.
Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X include proprietary
DEs. In some operating systems (especially Linux) it is possible to select your
own WM and set of graphical applications for a completely customized
experience.

Several of the following are [suckless](https://suckless.org) programs which
follow the suckless design philosophy. These are usually written in C and
include a core codebase with only a minimal set of features. Additional
features may be added by applying patches and/or directly modifying the code.
Configuration is done by editing a header file and recompiling. Use of such
software usually requires maintaining one's own version of the code base with
any customizations. While some people appreciate this workflow, most will
likely prefer more immutable software which is configured by an external
configuration file or scripts.

- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) A suckless tiling window manager for X11. Has
  inspired - or been used as a basis for - a number of other tiling window
  managers.

- [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus) A suckless status bar for X11.
  Pairs well with dwm for a suckless DIY setup.

- [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/) An extremely minimal suckless
  screen locking tool for X11.

- [dwl](https://codeberg.org/dwl) A port of dwm for Wayland.

- [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org) A window manager for X11 started as a
  fork of dwm that is non-suckless. Includes many features in the main code
  base and is highly configurable and extensible via Lua scripting.

- [OXWM](https://ox-docs.vercel.app) A window manager for X11 inspired by dwm
  which is written in Rust. Like Awesome WM, it is configured via Lua to forgo
  the suckless workflow where each user maintains their own variant of the
  source code. OXWM seems geared toward preserving the minimalist tiling
  experience of dwm, in contrast to Awesome, but includes sensible
  functionality that would require patches in dwm.

- [Niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri) A scrolling window manager for Wayland
  that supports some aspects of tiling. Here, each workspace is a row of windows
  where the windows may be spawned and removed as needed. One or more columns
  of the workspace can be on screen at a time. The user can navigate within
  and between workspaces, and dynamically rearrange the layout as desired.

- [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) A suckless X11 menu tool.
  Can readily be leveraged in scripts to create user defined menus. Menus can
  be quickly traversed using a fuzzy search. Something similar can be
  accomplished on the command line with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) A more sophisticated menu tool
  with support for both X11 and Wayland. Features a "dmenu emulation" mode
  allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement for dmenu.

- [waybar](https://waybar.org) A highly customizable status bar for use with
  Wayland window managers.

- [Awesome Wayland](https://github.com/rcalixte/awesome-wayland) A curated list
  of tools for Wayland.

## Graphical Interface

  browser.

- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) The open source web browser on which
  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) is based.

- [Virtual Machine Manager](https://virt-manager.org) An application to run and
  manage virtual machines. Uses the [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/)
  virtualization API. Both of these are open source.

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) Capture your PC's display, audio, and
  video for recording or streaming.

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) Audio recording, editing, and
  processing.

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) Image editing.

- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) a media player for audio and video.

- [Xournalpp](https://xournalpp.github.io) Take handwritten notes on your
  computer which can be edited and maintained as files. Especially useful with
  a writing tablet such as the
  [Wacom Intuous](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos).

- [Write](https://www.styluslabs.com) Another excellent program for handwritten
  notes by Stylus Labs. Appears to be free but not completely open source like
  Xournal.

- [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia) Open source tool for drawing diagrams.

## Terminal Interface

- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) A collection of open source tools that
  provides a Linux-like experience in Windows, especially through the command
  line.

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) Persistent terminal sessions that
  can be detached/attached and split into multiple panes. Here is a
  [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) with some useful
  commands and keybindings.

- [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen) An alternative to tmux; also
  provides persistent terminal sessions.

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org) Well-estabished text editor that can be used in
  non-graphical terminal environments. Tedious edits can often be accomplished
  with a small number of commands or keystrokes. A
  [cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com) can be helpful to keep nearby.

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) An alternative to Vim which has
  a different feel.

- [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) A user-friendly text editor for the
  terminal. Recommended over Vim and Emacs for new terminal users.

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) One of the standard shells for
  Linux-based systems. Supports scripting which can be used to automate tedious
  tasks.

- [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org) A well-established email client for the terminal.
  Also see [NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org) which is a fork of Mutt that supports
  some additional features.

- [Alpine](https://alpineapp.email) The successor of
  [Pine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190328145000/http://www.washington.edu/pine)
  which was another widely used email client for the terminal.
