I work at the
[Center for Statistical Research and Methodology](https://www.census.gov/srd/csrm) in the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Here is my
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Ai29GIAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

Previously, I was a graduate student in Statistics at UMBC. I worked
on problems in finite mixture models with
[Professor Nagaraj Neerchal](http://www.math.umbc.edu/~nagaraj).
My dissertation was [Computational Methods for Finite Mixtures using Approximate Information and
Regression Linked to the Mixture Mean](http://search.proquest.com/docview/1552496226).
I also worked with
[Professor Matthias Gobbert](http://www.math.umbc.edu/~gobbert)
as a research assistant for the
[High Performance Computing Facility (HPCF)](http://www.umbc.edu/hpcf).

Before that, I was a computer science student at [UMBC](http://www.csee.umbc.edu) and a software engineer at [Advertising.com / AOL](http://advertising.com).
