I work at the
[U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov)
in the
[Center for Statistical Research and Methodology](https://www.census.gov/srd/csrm).
I studied statistics at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). My
thesis focused on some problems involving finite mixture models. My thesis
advisor was
[Professor Nagaraj Neerchal](http://www.math.umbc.edu/~nagaraj).
I was also a research assistant with
[Professor Matthias Gobbert](http://www.math.umbc.edu/~gobbert)
for the
[High Performance Computing Facility (HPCF)](http://www.umbc.edu/hpcf).
Before statistics, I was a software engineer at
[Advertising.com / AOL](http://advertising.com)
and studied
[computer science](http://www.csee.umbc.edu)
at UMBC as an undergratuate.
