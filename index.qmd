:::{#about-heading}
Welcome to my website!

I have been a statistician at the Center for Statistical Research and
Methodology ([CSRM][csrm]) in the [U.S. Census Bureau][uscb] since 2014. I
worked as a software engineer for the first part of my career at the internet
advertising technology company [Advertising.com][adcom] in Baltimore. I
attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for
[computer science][csee] as an undergraduate and a part-time masters student,
then for [statistics][mathstat] as a graduate student.

I am an enthusiastic user of Linux and open source software. I attempt to
list favorite computing [resources](resources.qmd) as I discover them. I have
some [contributions](software.qmd) of my own, mostly in the form of R packages,
utilities, and document templates. I occasionally write [posts](posts.qmd)
about some of these things.

The best way to contact me is to email `andrew dot raim at gmail dot com`.
