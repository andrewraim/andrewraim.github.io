:::{#about-heading}
Welcome! This website hosts my publicly released work.

I have been a statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau Center for Statistical
Research and Methodology
([CSRM](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research.html)) since 2014.
I was previously a graduate student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County
([UMBC](https://mathstat.umbc.edu)) and worked as a software engineer for the
first part of my career at the internet advertising company Advertising.com.

The best way to contact me is to send email to `andrew dot raim at gmail dot
com`.
