:::{#about-heading}

Welcome to my website! I am a statistician and work in the
[Center for Statistical Research and Methodology](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research.html)
at the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov).
I try to post public work here. Contact me (andrew dot raim at gmail dot com)
if you are looking for something in particular that you cannot find it or have
other questions or feedback.
