:::{#about-heading}

Welcome! This website is intended to share my publicly released work with
anyone who may be interested. And to be able to find it myself. If you would
like contact me, the best way is to send email to `andrew dot raim at gmail dot
com`.

I have been a statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau Center for Statistical
Research and Methodology
([CSRM](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research.html)) since 2014.
I was previously a graduate student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County
([UMBC](https://mathstat.umbc.edu)) and worked as a software engineer for the
first part of my career at the internet advertising company Advertising.com.
