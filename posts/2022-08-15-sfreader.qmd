If you have needed to use decennial census data without access to the internet,
you may have encountered the raw data form of the summary files. These may be
downloaded from the Census Bureau website for offline use;
e.g., [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2010/dec/summary-file-2.html).
The format of the files is compact but can be difficult to navigate.
James Livsey, Kyle Irimata, and I prepared a
[technical report](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/adrm/SSC2022-01.html)
and a [package](https://github.com/andrewraim/sfreader)
to assist R users with this via the tidyverse. These materials focus
on the 2010 SF2 summary file, but support for others may be added in the future
as needed.
