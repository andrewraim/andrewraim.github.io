Much of the software listed here is free and open source with major
contributions from - or developed entirely by - dedicated community members. I
am grateful for the vast selection of reliable, high quality, and
readily-available software that has been developed under this philopsophy.

# Collaboration

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) Tool for source control management. Especially
  suitable for text-oriented material such as source code.

- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) a free hosting service for Git projects
  which is maintained by a non-profit organization in Berlin.

- The following are paid services that host Git projects
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org),
  [Github](https://github.com),
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
  They each have a free tier with limited hosting of private projects and use
  of [large file storage](https://git-lfs.com), but are a good option for
  enlisting collaborators who do not otherwise have an account.

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) Collaboration environment for writing
  Latex documents. Provides a browser-based editor, and also supports Git to
  work outside of the editor.

- Shared storage, for files other than source code:
  [Box](https://www.box.com),
  [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com),
  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
  

# Other Tools

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) A distribution of Linux maintained by
  the Canonical company. A number of variants are available such as a server
  edition and desktop editions with various window managers.

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) A distribution of Linux that follows a
  rolling release model. Good for keeping up with the most recent versions of
  packages. Also good for customization because the initial installation is
  minimal.

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) Capture your PC's display, audio, and
  video for recording or streaming.

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) Audio recording, editing, and
  processing.

  can be detached/attached and split into multiple panes. Here is a
  [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) with some useful
  commands and keybindings.

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org) Well-estabished text editor that can be used in
  non-graphical terminal environments. Tedious edits can often be accomplished
  with a small number of commands or keystrokes. A

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) An alternative to Vim which has
  a different feel.

- [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) A scheduler to queue up computing jobs
  and run them as processors become available. Useful for running large

  systems and distributed computing clusters, but also useful on a PC.

- [Xournalpp](https://xournalpp.github.io) Take handwritten notes on your
  computer which can be edited and maintained as files. Especially useful with
  a writing tablet such as the
  [Wacom Intuous](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos).

- [Write](https://www.styluslabs.com) Another excellent program for handwritten
