Much of the software listed here is free and open source with major
contributions from - or developed entirely by - dedicated community members. I
am grateful for the vast selection of reliable, high quality, and
readily-available software that has been developed under this philopsophy.

# Math/Stat Computing
* [The R Project for Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org)
	+ [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) A major repository of contributed R
	  packages
	+ [Posit](https://posit.co) Provides Rstudio, the premier integrated
	  development environment for R
	+ [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) A comprehesive package for
	  working with shapefiles and other geographic objects
	+ [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) Packages for data wrangling,
	  plotting, and other fundamental data science tasks
	+ [pbdR](https://pbdr.org) Packages for high-performance computing
	+ [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) Framework for integrating C++ into R
	+ [R-Nimble](http://r-nimble.org) Framework for constructing hierarchical
	  models with compiled code for high performance
	+ [LaplacesDemon](https://github.com/LaplacesDemonR/LaplacesDemon)
	  Full-featured library for Bayesian computation
* [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) Declare Bayesian models and compile into fast
  executable programs that sample posterior by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo;
  integrates with R and some other general purpose languages
* [OpenBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/openbugs) Linux
  variant of WinBUGS, one of the first (as far as I know) Bayesian modeling
  platforms that automate MCMC based on a user's model specification
* [The Julia Language](http://julialang.org)
  A high-level and high-performance language for technical computing
* [GNU Octave](https://octave.org) A scientific computing platform that is
  largely compatible with MATLAB, but is open source
* [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com) Search engine that can compute
  integrals, limits, etc

# Math/Stat Documents
* [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org) System for preparing high quality
  documents. Especially useful for typsetting mathematical expressions
* [beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) Package for making slides with Latex
* [UMBCposter](http://www.math.umbc.edu/~rouben/umbcposter) A Latex package
  for making posters. Developed and maintained by Dr. Rouben Rostamian at UMBC
* [beamerposter](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter) Another Latex package for
  making conference posters
* [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) IDE for authoring Latex documents.
* [pgf](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) Latex package for technical graphics. Also
  see [pgfplots](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots)
* [Quarto](https://quarto.org) Framework to generate articles, websites, books,
  and other documents with markdown and embedded R, Python, or Julia code

# Collaboration
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) Tool for source control management. Especially
  suitable for text-oriented material such as source code
* [Github](https://github.com) Hosts Git projects
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) Hosts Git projects
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) Collaboration environment for writing
  Latex documents. Provides a browser-based editor, and also supports Git to
  work outside of the editor.

# Other Tools
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) A popular distribution of Linux maintained by
  the Canonical company. A number of variants are available such as a server
  edition and desktop editions with various window managers
* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) Capture your PC's display, audio, and
  video for recording or streaming
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) Audio recording, editing, and
  processing
* [Flowblade](https://jliljebl.github.io/flowblade) Video editing
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) Image editing
* [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org) Extremely lightweight and minimalist tiling
  window manager
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) Persistent terminal sessions that
  can be detached/attached and split into multiple panes. Here is a
  [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) with some useful
  commands and keybindings
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org) Well-estabished text editor that can be used in
  non-graphical terminal environments. Tedious edits can often be accomplished
  with a small number of commands or keystrokes. A cheat sheet such as
  [this one](https://vim.rtorr.com) can be helpful to keep nearby
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) An alternative to Vim which has a
  different feel.
* [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) A scheduler that accepts computing jobs,
  queues them up, and runs them as resources become available. Useful for
  running large simulations. Most commonly used on multi-user systems and
  distributed computing clusters.
* [Xournalpp](https://xournalpp.github.io) Take handwritten notes on your
  computer which can be edited and maintained as files. Especially useful with
  a writing tablet such as the
  [Wacom Intuous](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos).
* [Write](https://www.styluslabs.com) Another excellent program for handwritten
  notes by Stylus Labs. Appears to be free but not completely open source like
  Xournal.
