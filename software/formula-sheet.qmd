title: LaTeX Formula Sheet
---

This is a template for a formula sheet in LaTeX.  Here is an
[example](/downloads/latex-formula-sheet/example.pdf) that uses the template.
To generate it, download the following files and place them together in the
same directory.

* [formula-sheet.cls](/downloads/latex-formula-sheet/formula-sheet.cls) the class
* [example.tex](/downloads/latex-formula-sheet/example.tex) the example

To generate the PDF on a standard Linux setup:

```bash
$ pdflatex example.tex
```

As usual, you may need to repeat the `pdflatex` command several times to
resolve references in the document. This should yield the PDF file
`example.pdf`. You should also be able to compile the example with your
favorite LaTeX IDE.
