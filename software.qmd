  sampling with a step function. Also see
  [DirectSampling.jl](https://github.com/andrewraim/DirectSampling.jl) for
  a Julia implementation.
- [COMMultReg](https://github.com/andrewraim/COMMultReg): Conway-Maxwell
  multinomial regression.
- [allocation](https://github.com/andrewraim/allocation): Exact optimal
  allocation algorithms for stratified sampling.
- [stcos](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stcos): Space-time change of support.
- [OverdispersionModelsInR](http://github.com/andrewraim/OverdispersionModelsInR):
  Some tools to help with MLE computation, especially for non-standard
  likelihoods found in overdispersion models.
- [LDR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ldr): Methods for likelihood-based
  dimension reduction in regression
- [ManifoldOptim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ManifoldOptim): An R
  interface to the ROPTLIB library for Riemannian manifold optimization.
- [MixLink](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mixlink): Mixture link regression.
- [COMPoissonReg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=COMPoissonReg):
  Conway-Maxwell Poisson (COM-Poisson) regression.

# LaTeX templates

- [latex-resume](software/latex-resume.qmd): a template for resumes/CVs.
- [latex-business-card](software/latex-business-card.qmd): a template for business cards.
- [beamerthemefoiltex](https://github.com/andrewraim/beamerthemefoiltex): a
  plain Beamer theme.
- [formula-sheet](software/formula-sheet.qmd): a template for formula sheets.
- [sweave-examples](https://github.com/andrewraim/sweave-examples): templates
  for Latex slides and articles using Sweave via knitr.

Note: I am not a LaTeX programmer, so there may be room for improvement in
these templates.

# Utilities

- [md-util](https://github.com/andrewraim/md-util): some command line scripts
  and templates to facilitate compiling markdown to various formats (PDF, html,
  Beamer) using Pandoc.
- [sim-util](https://github.com/andrewraim/sim-util): some tools to aid with
  repetitive computational studies, such as statistical simulations.
