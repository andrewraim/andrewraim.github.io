[George Ostrouchov](http://www.csm.ornl.gov/~ost/), [Nagaraj Neerchal](http://www.math.umbc.edu/people/neerchal.htm) and I are giving a two-day workshop **High Performance Statistical Computing using R** at the *International Conference on Recent Advances in Statistical Methodology with Applications in Clinical and Official Statistics* [(ICSA 2018)](https://icsa2018.wordpress.com/) at Department of Statistics, St. Thomas College, Pala, Kerala, India. An abstract and brief outline for the workshop are given [here](https://icsa2018.wordpress.com/workshop/).

The workshop builds up to parallel and distributed computing in R, but begins by introducing basics of working in R. Previous experience with R and Rstudio will be helpful, but much of the material should be accessible to new R users with experience in another technical computing language such as Matlab, Python, or Julia. Applications involving statistical and machine learning methods will be presented throughout the workshop. A bachelors degree in a discipline such as statistics, computer science, or mathematics-or equivalent work experience-should be sufficient to understand the methodology.

Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops. Many example codes will be provided, and some portions of the workshop will give an opportunity for users to follow along. *For attendees who are planning to bring a laptop, instructions for setting up your machine will be posted here in the coming days*.

We will focus on Rcpp programming in RStudio, which provides a common
interface across all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux), and helps to
automate some procedural tasks.

1. Install R (<http://www.r-project.org>). The current version as of this
writing is 3.4.1 "Single Candle".
2. Install RStudio Desktop (<http://www.rstudio.com>). The current version is
1.0.153.
3. Install the `Rcpp`, `RcppArmadillo`, and `RcppGSL` packages.
4. Some additional libraries may be needed to compile C++ programs on your
computer. These differ depending on your operating system. See
<http://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites>.

This may be a good time to upgrade if you have older versions of R, RStudio, or
any of the listed packages.

To test your Rcpp environment, try the following in RStudio.

1. Select `File => New File => C++ File` from the main menu. This will create
a simple Rcpp program.
2. Save the program, say, as `example.cpp`.
3. Click the `Source` button, which is located in the upper-right corner of
the panel with the `example.cpp` source code. This should produce the output
``` R
